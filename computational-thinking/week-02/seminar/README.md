# Computational Thinking Seminar 02

It is usually the case that students are asked to take a very active role in their seminars and all students will be invited to speak and contribute to discussions. In this way, it is not only academic understanding that you will gain but also the chance to develop a wide range of personal and key skills. These may include how best to communicate and present your views and to build your confidence when speaking in front of other students. This Seminar is aiming for below objectives:

- Providing an opportunity to explore a topic in depth.
- Analysing and critically evaluating different viewpoints.
- Developing a wide range of communication and study skills.
- Building confidence.
- Easing communication between students and tutors.

### 10 Minute Seminar Presentation Guide

Here is an example of an outline for a 10-minute seminar presentation which you could possibly adapt for your own circumstances and needs.

**The topic of the Seminar – Coding isn’t the same as computational thinking.**

As Stephen Wolfram candidly puts it:

>  Coding isn’t the same as computational thinking

We can broadly think of it as a method of formalised problem-solving. 

1. **Is computational thinking programming?**
2. **What is the difference between computational thinking and programming?** 

Stephen Wolfram is a British-American computer scientist, physicist, and businessman. He is known for his work in computer science, mathematics, and in theoretical physics. In 2012, he was named an inaugural fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
