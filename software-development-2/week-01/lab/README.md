# Software Development 2 Lab 01 -- Getting Started with C

There are many ways you can develop in C and C++. Today there are three main compilers:

- GNU Compiler Collection -- `gcc`
- `clang`
- Microsoft C/C++ Compiler -- `cl`

We are going to focus on using Microsoft's compiler although you can use any compiler. The C and C++ we use is a standard. How you compile programs will be different.

If your machine is not setup with Visual Studio Code and a C/C++ compiler, use either of the following instructions. You only need go as far running the first built program:

- [Microsoft C/C++](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc)
- [Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-linux)
- [MacOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-clang-mac)

From now on, we will provide instructions only for Microsoft C/C++ on Windows 10. Once you are setup, perform the following steps:

1. Open the Developer Command Prompt for VS.
2. In the command prompt, change to your user folder; e.g., `cd C:\Users\student\`.
3. Now create a new folder where you will undertake your work; e.g., `mkdir sd2`.
4. Change into your new folder; e.g., `cd sd2`.
5. Now start Visual Studio Code from this folder by typing `code .`.

**You will always have to start Visual Studio Code in this manner so it sees the Microsoft C/C++ tools. This is just how Microsoft have set this up.**

We are now ready to learn some C.
