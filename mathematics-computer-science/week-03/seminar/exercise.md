**Solve the following mathematical problems.**

1. Let $f$ be the function that assigns the last two bits of a bit string of length two or greater to that string. Then the domain of $f$ is the set of all bit strings of length greater than or equal to two. Now find the set of the codomain and range for the following functions.
   1. $f(1010101)$
   2. $f(1010111)$
   3. $f(010)$
   4. $f(101000)$
   5. $f(11)$
2. Let $f : Z \to Z$ assign an integer to its square. Then, $f(x) = x^2$, where the domain of $f$ is the set of all integers, the codomain of $f$ is the set of all integers. Define the range of $f$.
3. Determine whether the function $f(x) = x^2 + 2$ is a one-to-one function where the domain is the integers and the codomain the positive integers.
4. Is the function $f(x) = x + 1$ from the set of integers to the set of integers an *onto* function?
5. Determine whether the following functions are invertible or not.
   1. Let $f : Z \to Z$ be such that $f(x) = x + 1$. Is $f$ invertible, and if so what is its inverse?
   2. Let $f : R \to R$ be such that $f(x) = x^2$. Is $f$ invertible, and if so what is its inverse?
6. Find the following values.
   1. $\lceil 1/2 \rceil$
   2. $\lfloor -1/2 \rfloor$
   3. $\lfloor 3.960 \rfloor$
   4. $\lfloor -9.9 \rfloor$
   5. $\lceil -2.4 \rceil$
   6. $\lceil 2.5 \rceil$
   7. $\lfloor -5.67 \rfloor$
   8. $\lfloor 1.3 \rfloor$
   9. $\lfloor 1.9 \rfloor$
   10. $\lceil 2.0 \rceil$
7. Let $g$ be the function from the set $\{a, b, c\}$ to itself such that $g(a) = b$, $g(b) = c$, and $g(c) = a$. Let $f$ be the function from the set $\{a, b, c\}$ to the set $\{1, 2, 3\}$ such that $f(a) = 3$, $f(b) = 2$, and $f(c) = 1$. What is the composition of $f$ and $g$, and what is the composition of $g$ and $f$?
8. Find $(f - h)(x)$ if $f(x) = 5x^2 + 2x - 5$ and $h(x) = 4x^2 - 10$.
