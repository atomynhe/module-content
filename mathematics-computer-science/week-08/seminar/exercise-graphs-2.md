6. What is the length of the shortest path between $a$ and $z$ from the graph below? How can you determine the shortest path?

7. How many regions are there in the following Planar Graph?

8. Let’s consider an example of a GeoLocation of Earth. The cities are $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ and $E$ respectively. Now if you want to represent the cities from the map using a graph then how can you do that? Hint: Represent the scenario using a planar graph, where each city is a vertex and the cities sharing the common border will be connected by an edge] Also identify the number of chromatics you need to represent the graph using “Graph colouring theorem”.
