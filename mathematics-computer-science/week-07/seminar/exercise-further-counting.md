**Solve the following problems.**

1. How many students must be in a class to guarantee that at least two students receive the same score on the final exam if the exam is graded on a scale from 0 to 100?
2. How many cards must be selected from a standard deck of 52 cards to guarantee that at least three cards of the same suit are chosen?
3. Suppose that a computer science laboratory has 15 workstations and 10 servers. A cable can be used to directly connect a workstation to a server. For each server, only one direct connection to that server can be active at any time. We want to guarantee that at any time any set of 10 or fewer workstations can simultaneously access different servers via direct connections. Although we could do this by connecting every workstation directly to every server (using 150 connections), what is the minimum number of direct connections needed to achieve this goal?
4. Encrypt the plaintext message "STOP GLOBAL WARMING" using the shift cipher with shift $k = 11$.
5. Decrypt the ciphertext message "LEWLYPLUJL PZ H NYLHA ALHJOLY" that was encrypted with the shift cipher with shift $k = 7$.
6. Suppose that we intercepted the ciphertext message "ZNK KGXRE HOXJ MKZY ZNK CUXS" that we know was produced by a shift cipher. What was the original plaintext message?
7. What is the greatest common divisor of 17 and 22?
8. Determine whether the integers 10, 17, and 21 are pairwise relatively prime.
