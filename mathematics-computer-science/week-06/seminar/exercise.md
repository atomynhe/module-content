**Solve the problems below.**

1. What is the truth value of $\forall x P(x)$, where $P(x)$ is the statement $x^2 < 10$ and the domain consists of the positive integers not exceeding 4?
2. What is the truth value of $\forall x P(x)$, where $P(x)$ is the statement $x^2 < 10$ and the domain consists of the positive integers less than 4?
3. Let $P(x)$ denote the statement $x > 0$. What is the truth value of the quantification $\exists x P(x)$, where the domain consists of integers?
4. Let $P(x)$ denote the statement $x > 0$. What is the truth value of the quantification $\forall x P(x)$, where the domain consists of non-negative integers?
5. Let $P(x)$ denote the statement $x > 0$. What is the truth value of the quantification $\exists x P(x)$, where the domain consists of negative integers?
6. Let $P(x)$ denote the statement $x < 2$. What is the truth value of the quantification $\exists x P(x)$, where the domain consists of all prime numbers?
7. Let $P(x)$ denote the statement $x \leq 2$. What is the truth value of the quantification $\exists x P(x)$, where the domain consists of all prime numbers?
8. Let $P(x)$ be the statement *"$x$ can speak Spanish"* and let $Q(x)$ be the statement *"$x$ knows the computer language C++"*. Express each of the following sentences in the terms of $P(x)$, $Q(x)$, quantifiers, and logical connectives. The domain for quantifiers consists of all students at the university.
   1. There is a student at your university who can speak Spanish and who knows C++.
   2. There is a student at your university who can speak Spanish but who doesn't know C++.
   3. Every student at your university can either speak Spanish or knows C++.
   4. No student at your school can speak Spanish or knows C++.
9. Translate each of the statements into logical expressions using predicates, quantifiers, and logical connectives.
   1. No one is perfect.
   2. Not everyone is perfect.
   3. All your friends are perfect.
   4. At least one of your friends is perfect.
   5. Everyone is your friend and is perfect.
   6. Not everybody is your friend or someone is not perfect.
10. Consider the statements below. The first two are called premises and the third is called the conclusion. Let's assume the domain consists of all creates. Express the statements in the argument using the quantifiers and $P(x)$, $Q(x)$, and $R(x)$, where $P(x)$, $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$ are: *"$x$ is a lion"*, *"$x$ is fierce"*, and *"$x$ drinks coffee"* respectively.
    1. All lions are fierce.
    2. Some lions do not drink coffee.
    3. Some fierce creatures do not drink coffee.
