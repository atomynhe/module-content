**Solve the following mathematical problems.**

1. Which of the following are propositions? What are the truth valuse of those that are propositions?
   1. Obama is one of the former presidents of the USA.
   2. Knowledge of statistics is very necessary in data science.
   3. It is used to do mathematical analysis.
   4. Swimming is a very good exercise.
   5. What to do?
   6. $7 \gt 9$
   7. Do you think it's OK if the final exam is next week?
   8. This is very difficult.
   9. The cow has three legs.
   10. Let's plan for our next holiday!
   11. $x + 2 = 13$
   12. $x + y = z$
2. Given $P$ = *"I am going to town"*, what is the declarative statement $\neg P$?
3. Let us consider $p$ = *"Cruise ships only go on large rivers"*, $q$ = *"Cruise ships go on the Hudson"*, and $r$ = *"The Hudson is a large river."* Write the following logical statements.
   1. $p \land r$
   2. $(p \land q) \implies r$
   3. $q \iff r$
   4. $\neg r \implies \neg q$
   5. $r \implies q$
4. Consider the following propositions. $p$ = *"It is Friday"* and $q$ = *"It is raining"*. Construct the propositions:
   1. $p \land q$
   2. $p \lor q$
5. Let $p$ = *"You can take the flight"* and $q$ = *"You buy a ticket."* Construct the propositions:
   1. $p \iff q$
   2. $q \oplus \neg p$
6. Let $p$ = *"Team-A will win Tournament-2020"*, $q$ = *"Tournament-2020 will be very difficult"*, and $r$ = *"Team-A is well prepared"*. Write the following propositions using $p$, $q$, $r$, and logic symbols.
   1. If Team-A is well prepared, then Tournament-2020 will not be very difficult.
   2. Team-A is not well prepared.
   3. Team-A will win Tournament-2020 if and only if the team is well prepared.
   4. Team-A won't win the tournament unless Team-A is well prepared.
   5. Team-A is well prepared, or Team-A won't win Tournament-2020.
7. What are the **converse**, **contrapositive**, and **inverse** of the conditional statement $x \implies y$, where $x$ = *"It is noon"*, and $y$ = *"I am hungry"*?
