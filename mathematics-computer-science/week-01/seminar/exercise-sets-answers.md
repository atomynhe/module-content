1. Represent the sets.
   1. S = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} or {s | s positive integer and s is odd and s less than 10}
   2. V = {a, e, i, o} or {v | v is a vowel and v is not "u"}
   3. {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47}
2. TRUE statements
   1. TRUE
   2. FALSE. The set of natural numbers does not include negative numbers.
   3. TRUE.
   4. FALSE. The set of positive integers does not include 0.
   5. FALSE. A square number is always positive.
3. $$2^{|S|} = 2^4 = 16$$
4. Set cardinality.
   1. 3
   2. 3
   3. 0
   4. 3
   5. 26
   6. 1
   7. Undefined. The set is infinite.
5. FALSE statements.

   7. TRUE
   8. TRUE
   9. TRUE
   10. FALSE. $$x$$ Is the only element of the set.
6. Product sets.
   1. {(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5)}
   2. {(1, 2, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 2, 5), (1, 3, 3), (1, 3, 4), (1, 3, 5)}
