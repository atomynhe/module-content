**Solve the following mathematical problems.**

1. Consider the sets $P=\{11, 33, 44\}$, $Q=\{11, 44\}$, and $R=\{11, 33\}$. Perform the following operations and represent the Venn diagram for each of the set operations below.
   1. $P \cup Q \cup R$
   2. $P \cap R$
   3. $Q'$
   4. $R - P$
   5. $P \oplus R$
2. Prove that $\overline{A \cup B} = \overline{A} \cap \overline{B}$. Hint -- you can use a membership table or set builder notation.
3. Let's consider that the universal set, $U$, is finite and $U = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\}$. Represent the appropriate bit strings for subsets based on the following statements:
   1. All odd integers.
   2. All even integers.
   3. All integers less than or equal to 5.
   4. The complement of the subset $\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$
