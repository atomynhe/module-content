**Solve the following mathematical problems.**

1. Using direct proof prove that the sum of any two odd integers is even.
2. Prove that, for any even integer $n$, $-1^n = 1$.
3. Show that at least four of any 22 days must fall on the same day of the week.
4. Show that $(n \geq 1) \implies (n^2 \geq n)$.
5. Prove that in $5x + 25y = 1723$, $x$ or $y$ is not an integer, where $x$ and $y$ are both real numbers.
6. Use direct proof to show that the sum of two even integers will result in an even integer.
7. Prove that if $a + b$ and $b + c$ are even integers, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are integers, then $a + c$ is also even. Which proof technique do you use?
8. Prove or disprove that the product of a nonzero rational number and an irrational number is irrational.
9. Use proof by contraposition to show that is $x + y \geq 2$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, then $x \geq 1$ or $y \geq 1$.
10. Show, using contradiction, that if $n$ is an integer and $n^3 + 5$ is odd, then $n$ is even.
