# Computer Systems Seminar 9 -- Benchmarks and Amdahl's Law

1. Suppose 50% of the computation is inherently sequential, and the other 50% can be parallelised. How much faster could the computation potentially run on infinite processors?

2. Suppose 10% of the computation is inherently sequential, and the other 90% can be parallelised. How much faster could the computation potentially run on infinite processors?

3. Addition instructions are improved to be executed twice as fast. But, only 10% of the time was originally spent on this task. What is the speedup of the new machine?
   1. What is the speedup when the addition task is 50 times faster?
   2. What is the speedup when 24% of the time is spent on the task?
   3. What is the speedup when 35% of the time is spent on the task and the task is 75% faster?

4. Computers M1 and M2 are two implementations of the same workload. M1 has a clock rate of 50 MHz and M2 has a clock rate of 100 MHz. M1 has a CPI of 2.3 and M2 has a CPI of 3.1 for a given program.
   1. How many times faster is M2 than M1 for this program?
   2. What would the clock rate of M1 to have the same execution time as M2?

5. Assume that a program is executed in 50 seconds in a computer system, with multiply operations that responsible for 30 seconds. How much improvement is needed for the multiplication speed if the program is to run 2 times faster.

6. What is the Speedup value required for a system to run 40 times faster when the percentage of the parallelised task is 42% of the time.
