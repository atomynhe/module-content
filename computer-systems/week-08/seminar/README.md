# Computer Systems Seminar 8 -- Introduction to System Performance Evaluation

1. What are the components of a computer system whose performance can be evaluated?

2. Can you differentiate between real and synthetic workloads?

3. Can you differentiate between static and dynamic workloads?

4. Three computer systems were issued with a set of tasks. System A completed the tasks in 6 seconds, System B completed the tasks in 4 seconds and System C completed the task in 10 seconds. 
   1. Calculate the performance of each system.
   2. Use the performance to evaluate the best performing system.

5. Using the mean calculation, calculate the mean for each computer in the table below and determine the fastest:

|                  | **Operations** | **Time (Secs)** |             |             |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
|                  |                | Computer  A     | Computer  B | Computer  C |
| Program  1       | 100            | 20              | 5           | 15          |
| Program  2       | 100            | 100             | 50          | 25          |
| Program  3       | 75             | 15              | 5           | 20          |
| Program  4       | 50             | 5               | 25          | 10          |
| Total            |                |                 |             |             |
| Arithmetic  Mean |                |                 |             |             |

6. Lampard University just appointed you as their system analyst. Your first task is to evaluate the performance of their IT infrastructure. You have been requested to produce a report for evaluating both their network and individual computer systems. Outline five workloads and metrics for evaluating the individual computers and the network respectively. 

7. Calculate the number of cycles for a processor whose CPI is 5 and the number of instructions is 120.

8. Calculate the number of instructions for a processor whose CPI is 5 and the number of cycles is 75.

9. Calculate the CPU time with the values below; 
   - instructions = 500
   - program = 25
   - number of cycles = 75
   - instructions = 15
   - time = 150 seconds

10. Differentiate between the descriptive model and generative model.
