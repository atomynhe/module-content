## Octal Output

We can ask our C program to output data in octal format. Create a file called `octal.c` with the following code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    uint8_t x = 0;
    uint8_t y = 100;
    uint8_t z = 200;
    printf("%i in octal is %o\n", x, x);
    printf("%i in octal is %o\n", y, y);
    printf("%i in octal is %o\n", z, z);
    return 0;
}
```

The `%o` placeholder in `printf` tells the program to print out the octal version of the data. We’re not changing the data, we’re just telling the computer to print it in a different format, which is an easy thing for the computer to do. Compiling and running this program gives:

```bash
student@ML-RefVm-999999:~/computer-systems/lab01$ gcc octal.c
student@ML-RefVm-999999:~/computer-systems/lab01$ ./a.out
0 in octal is 0
100 in octal is 144
200 in octal is 310
```

## Hexadecimal Output

We can also output data from C in a hexadecimal format. The following program, `hex.c` illustrates:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    uint8_t x = 0;
    uint8_t y = 100;
    uint8_t z = 200;
    printf("%i in hex is %x\n", x, x);
    printf("%i in hex is %x\n", y, y);
    printf("%i in hex is %x\n", z, z);
    return 0;
}
```

`%x` is the placeholder for printing data as a hexadecimal value. Compiling and running the program gives us:

```bash
student@ML-RefVm-999999:~/computer-systems/lab01$ gcc hex.c
student@ML-RefVm-999999:~/computer-systems/lab01$ ./a.out
0 in hex is 0
100 in hex is 64
200 in hex is c8
```

## Binary

C unfortunately does not provide a mechanism for printing data as binary. So we will have to convert the number to binary using the method described in the lecture. Don’t worry too much about how this works at the moment. Once you’ve studied enough programming come back to the code and it will make far more sense.

> This program is very much a hack to get around the lack of binary output in C. It won’t work on negative numbers.

Our test program, `binary.c` is below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

void binary(uint8_t n)
{
    if (n > 1)
        // Divide by 2 and repeat.
        binary(n / 2);
    // Print remainder.
    printf("%i", n % 2);
}

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    uint8_t x = 0;
    uint8_t y = 100;
    uint8_t z = 200;
    printf("%i in binary is ", x);
    binary(x);
    printf("\n");
    printf("%i in binary is ", y);
    binary(y);
    printf("\n");
    printf("%i in binary is ", z);
    binary(z);
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
}
```

Compiling and running gives us:

```bash
student@ML-RefVm-999999:~/computer-systems/lab01$ gcc binary.c
student@ML-RefVm-999999:~/computer-systems/lab01$ ./a.out
0 in binary is 0
100 in binary is 1100100
200 in binary is 11001000
```

## Integer Types

There are a number of different integer sizes we can use in C:

- `uint16_t` for unsigned 16-bit values (65,535 maximum value).
- `uint32_t` for unsigned 32-bit values (4,294,967,295 maximum value).
- `uint64_t` for unsigned 64-bit values (18,446,744,073,709,551,615 maximum value).
