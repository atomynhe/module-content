We will finish this lab examining how text is represented in the computer. There are actually a few different methods, but the most common is [ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) - the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. ASCII is quite simple. It just represents characters of text as numbers. For example, 32 represents a space.

A simple program to demonstrate this, `ascii.c`, is below:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    char x = 'K';
    char y = 'e';
    char z = 'v';
    printf("%c is %i (%x)\n", x, x, x);
    printf("%c is %i (%x)\n", y, y, y);
    printf("%c is %i (%x)\n", z, z, z);
    return 0;
}
```

```bash
student@ML-RefVm-999999:~/computer-systems/lab01$ gcc ascii.c
student@ML-RefVm-999999:~/computer-systems/lab01$ ./a.out
K is 75 (4b)
e is 101 (65)
v is 118 (76)
```

The point of this exercise is to show you that we can represent text with numbers, which we represent with binary. Everything in the computer is represented by numbers. For information, a complete ASCII table is below.
