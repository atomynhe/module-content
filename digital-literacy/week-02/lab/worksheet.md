# Operating systems worksheet

### Investigate the following questions:

1. How many CPU cores do you have?
2. Which programs are taking up the most CPU?
3. Which programs are taking up the most memory?
4. Can you think of how you could use this information to improve the performance of your computer?

Please capture evidence for your answers.  Screenshots and some notes will be fine.

##### Some tools that may help you:

Linux/Mac: System monitor and/or type the following in a terminal window:

`top`

`ps auxf`

or

`pstree`

Windows: task manager, system monitor (additional program)

##### Expert tip

If you are using terminal commands type:

`man <command>`

In the terminal window to get more information.

(man is short for 'manual' in this case)
