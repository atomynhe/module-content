# Operating systems worksheet

### Investigate the following questions:

1. How many CPU cores do you have?
2. Which programs are taking up the most CPU?
3. Which programs are taking up the most memory?
4. Can you think of how you could use this information to improve the performance of your computer?

Please capture evidence for your answers.  Screenshots and some notes will be fine.

##### Tools you will need:

**Linux** (Use the Azure labs instance - instructions linked from Moodle):
Type the following in a terminal window
See how much you can find out.  You don't need to understand everything, you just should get accustomed to using the command line and going digging for information.

`top`

`htop`

`ps auxf`

`lscpu`

`pstree`

`pstree -th`

**Windows**: open the task manager, 'performance' tab

##### Expert tip

If you are using terminal commands type:

`man <command>`

In the terminal window to get more information.

(man is short for 'manual' in this case)

To return from the 'man' page to your terminal prompt, press the letter q on your keyboard.
