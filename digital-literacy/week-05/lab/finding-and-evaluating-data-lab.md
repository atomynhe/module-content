# Data sources and evaluating information

## Part 1: Beginning your data project

### What we will do today:

- Choose a theme  
- Plan your project
- Search for information and data
- Use RADAR to evaluate at least four sources
- Consider format and copyright
- Record your decision making process based on the information - use your OneNote class notebook to record your work.
- Start to consider how this work will feed into your assessment

### Lets get started!

#### 1. Planning

Choose a topic that interests you, and consider the following:

- What is the inquiry question you are trying to answer or topic you are exploring (be prepared to iterate!)?
- What information do you already have?
- What additional information do you need?
- What type of information do you need? for example, an overview, detailed analysis/research, statistics, different points of view
- How much information  do you need â€” what gaps are there in your knowledge?
- Do you need to re-use or re-publish the data (copyright/open data)

#### 2. Finding information

- Are there any go-to data or information sources you should try first?, eg.who are the main organisations, institutions or publications involved with your topic?  Note these down.
- If you are going to use search engines, use structured queries to find information.  Note your findings.

Task:
Find an example of each (relevant) different type of information for your topic

Source type  | Source  | Note  |
--|---|---|
Journalistic  |   |   
Peer reviewed|   |   |
User contributed|   |   |
Marketing/advertising|   |   |   
Campaigning/lobbying|   |   |    
Structured 'raw' data   |   |   |  

#### 3. Evaluating information

Apply the RADAR test to each of your information sources.  Create this grid for each source.

Initial  | Test | Note
--|---|---|   
**R**| Reason  |   
**A**| Authority |   |
**D**| Date  |   |
**A**| Accuracy   |   |   
**R**| Relevance  |   |    

Also consider the following points:

- If you wish to re-use any raw data, are there any copyright or licensing restrictions?
- Is there any bias in your data based on social factors such as race or gender that you can correct with additional research?


#### NEXT STEPS

Get ready for the next class in which we will download data and process it using a spreadsheet application.
