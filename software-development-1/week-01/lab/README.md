Week 1 problem set

1. Identify what kind of operators/values each one is:
 * 
 ‘hi’ 
 -99.1
 -
 /
 +
 2
 0.00
 **
 “My dog ate my homework"

 
2. What’s the difference between variable x, and string “x"?


3. Name three data types and what can they be used for (example)


4. What is an expression made up of? What do expressions do?


5. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?


6. What does the variable counter contain after the following code runs? 
counter = 20
counter + 1

7. What should the following two expressions evaluate to?
"hi" + 'hihi' "hello " * 3

8. Is socks a valid variable name? How about 9000? What’s the difference

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point
number, or string version of a value?

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.’

Search online for the Python documentation for the len() function. It will be on a web page titled “Built-in Functions.” Skim the list of other functions Python has, look up what the round() function does, and experiment with it in the interactive shell.


11. In a print statement, what happens if you leave out one of the parentheses, or both?


12. If you are trying to print a string, what happens if you leave out one of the quotation marks, or both?


13. You can use a minus sign to make a negative number like -2. What happens if you put a plus sign before a number? What about 2++2?


14. In math notation, leading zeros are okay, as in 02. What happens if you try this in Python?


15. What happens if you have two values with no operator between them?

16. Use Python as a calculator.
1. How many seconds are there in one year?
2. How many kilometers are there in 68 miles? Hint: there are 1.61 kilometers in a mile.
3. If you run a 10 K race in 55 minutes and 40 seconds, what is your average pace (time per kilometer in minutes and seconds)? What is your average speed in miles per hour?

17. Are these statements valid in python?
  n = 68
  42 = x
  x = y = 1?

18. In some languages every statement ends with a semicolon, ;. What happens if you put a semicolon at the end of a Python statement? What if you put a period at the end of a statement?

19 In math notation you can multiply x and y like this: xy. What happens if you try that in Python?

20. Make a program to calculate the area of a spere given the radius
