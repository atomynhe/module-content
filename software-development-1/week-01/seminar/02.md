# Seminar Workshop 01 -- Part 2: Drawing Lines

Your group have access to a new computer which can also perform the following operation.

```
DRAW WIDTH THICK COLOUR LINE FROM START TO END
```

`WIDTH` tells the computer how thick a line to draw. It is a number representing how thick the line should be.

`DRAW ... LINE ...` works as `DRAW ... RECTANGLE ...` except it draws a straight line between two points. The thickness of the line is whatever was set last.

For example, consider the England flag.

To draw this flag we need to issue the following instructions:

```
DRAW 72 THICK RED LINE FROM (300, 0) TO (300, 400)
DRAW 72 THICK RED LINE FROM (0, 200) TO (600, 200)
```
