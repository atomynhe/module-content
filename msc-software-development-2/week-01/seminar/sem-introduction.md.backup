Fill in the gaps! 

Production - The pages and server-side functionality are accessed over the internet

Development with containers - The pages and server-side functionality AND the client side (browser) are all one computer BUT the server-side software is in Docker 'containers' to allow for consistent development environments.  This version also shows your software development tools - IDE (visual studio code for development and GIT for version control, connected online to github, allowing you to share with colleagues)
