# Coursework Assessment Details

## Coursework Specification

The coursework is worth 100% of the total module mark.

In this coursework you are tasked with creating a dynamic web application for the smooth and efficient operation of a business of your choosing. Hence you are required to specify what type of business you will be building your application for. 

**Your application must be built using the tools and techniques taught in the module, although there is some flexibility.**

- Your web front-end must use Angular.js. If you want to use a different front-end web framework then you must seek permission from the teaching team first.
- Your web back-end must run via Node.js. This is not negotiable.
- Your front-end and back-end must communicate via Express.js. If you want to use a different routing library then you must seek permission from the teaching team first.
- Your application must use a database for storage. We will teach you SQLite, but you can use other database systems such as MySQL or a NoSQL system such as MongoDB. You must discuss this choice with the teaching team first.
- Your application must be version controlled using Git and publicly accessible on GitHub. This is not negotiable.
- Your application must be deployable as a Docker container. This is not negotiable.

### Advice on Application Choice

We are not looking for anything sophisticated in your application. Fundamentally, you should aim to develop a [CRUD application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete). A CRUD application is effectively a front-end to a database, providing a method to create, read, update, and delete data from a web site to a database on a server.

An example tutorial on building a CRUD application using JavaScript and HTML forms is available here: [JavaScript CRUD Example Tutorial (javaguides.net)](https://www.javaguides.net/2020/11/javascript-crud-example-tutorial.html). An example image of a potential front-end for a CRUD application is below.

## Deliverables

The aim is to deliver the final version of your application. The final version of your application will be pulled automatically from GitHub. The final submission will be assessed based on the following criteria.

- Overall application quality.
- Metrics from GitHub.
- Code quality including comments.
- Application containerised with Docker.
- Final version of the task board and project requirements met.

### Individual Reflection on Team Working

A report reflecting on the overall project and how team working concepts discussed in the module would have supported your project. This reflection should be a maximum of 1000 words.

| **Software design** the suitability and completeness of the software design presented given the application design proposed. | Use case diagrams that clearly map to user stories provided and provide high-quality information of the system design. Activity diagrams are of high-quality illustrating the flow of control in the application. Suitable class, state, and sequence diagrams are also provided based on the idea specified. | Use case diagrams generally map to user stories and provide good-quality information of the system design. Activity diagrams are good-quality but no not cover the complete flow of control in the application. Suitable class, state, and sequence diagrams are also provided based on the idea specified. | Use case diagrams do not map well to user stories and are lacking in some detail. Activity diagrams also lack some detail on the overall flow of control in the system. Class, state and sequence diagrams are sparse. | No diagrams provided, or use case diagrams do not map to user stories. Activity diagrams not provided, do not cover much or the system flow of control, or are inappropriate. Class, state and sequence diagrams not provided or are inappropriate. |
| **Technical progress** the degree of progress made in the delivery of their technical requirements. | Excellent progress made towards delivering a final version of the product based on the current project and individual capabilities. | Made satisfactory progress towards delivering the final product version based on the current project and individual capabilities. | Not made satisfactory progress towards delivering the final product version based on the current project and individual capabilities. | No progress made, or progress is minimal at best.            |
| **GitHub repository practice** evidence of good practice in GitHub. | Obvious evidence of good Git practice with commits frequent and small. | Commits are not always frequent and small.                   | Commit practice needs work.                                  | Commit practice is non-existent or poor.                     |
| **Docker deployment** the completeness of the Docker configuration to run the necessary application. | Dockerfile defined that incorporates all the necessary components. package.json file fully defines how to install and run the application. | Dockerfile defined that incorporates most of the necessary components. package.json file exists but does not include everything to fully install and run the application. | Basic Dockerfile defined. package.json exists but does not include everything to fully install and run the application. | No Dockerfile defined. package.json not defined or is just the basic initial one. |
| **Database integration** the completeness of the database implementation and integration into the application. | Database has been fully designed and implemented to support the project. All necessary data for the project has been entered. | Database has been fully designed and implemented to support the project. Only minimal data added at this point. | Database is not yet fully designed and implemented. Therefore, only minimal data is available. | Database has not been designed and implemented, or has very minimal design and implementation. |
| **RESTful interfaces** the completeness of the RESTful interfaces implemented to support the project. | RESTful endpoints fully defined and implemented using an appropriate library.
