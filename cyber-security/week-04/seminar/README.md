# Case Study

The Board of Directors at an international financial services organisation, headquartered in London with offices in financial centres throughout the world, including Paris, New York and Hong Kong, are considering a confidential merger offer.

On a Friday afternoon, before a three-day weekend, the CIO received a ransom email from an unknown source stating they knew about the merger plans and had personal details of 150,000 customers. A sample of personal information for 500 customers was included in the ransom email as "proof". Unless a significant ransom was paid in Bitcoin, they would leak the merger plans and sell the customer information. Herbert Smith Freehills was immediately engaged as legal counsel to manage and advise on the incident response and started work immediately, aided by forensic computer specialists, to assess and contain the threat.

The threat was confirmed to be real as 500 customers information was already released on Dark Web. It was discovered that the attack was initiated through the retrieval of information about the CEO. This information was used to construct an email received by her Executive Assistant (the "EA"). The email appeared to be from the sponsor of a recent conference with an attachment described as an expense reporting form. The EA opened the email and downloaded the expense form. The form contained malware that created an administrative level account.
