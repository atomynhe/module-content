# Cybersecurity Seminar 07 -- Secure Design

Admin Corp runs a plant that produces Adminox, a highly volatile, refined form of administrative paperwork that is essential to every organisation in the country. It is created from volatile raw products using a continuous chemical process.

As an essential service, Admin Corp must comply with the EU Directive. This means that Admin Corp's network, information systems and technology needed to produce Adminox must be protected from cyberattack.

Also, because Admin Corp are regulated for safety by the UK Health and Safety Executive, they must take steps to ensure the continued safety of the Adminox production process.

## Admin Corp - system requirements

The process for producing Adminox involves several steps, with the final product stored under pressure in a tank. Clearly, no one would benefit from the unconstrained release of this Adminox, with the potential for additional red tape clogging up local services for years.

Admin Corp's system therefore has two critical non-functional requirements:

- As a responsible and safety regulated company, they need to keep the local environment safe from release of Adminox.
- Maintaining the availability of the product for customers to continue as a profitable company.

Walk through each of the NCSC design principles and see how they can be applied to achieve the requirements.
