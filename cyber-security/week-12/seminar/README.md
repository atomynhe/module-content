Fledgeling social media platform, ‘Chatter’, launched in September 2017. Its primary users are 13-21-year-olds. Users can: 

- Share photos and post status updates 
- Send messages via a private chat
- Play games with other users and make in-app purchases 

Their head office is in Birmingham, and they employ 30 people. All staff members have a staff pass to enter the building and have a company iPhone and laptop. All staff have received an email outlining the best practice for cybersecurity, but everyone and staff did not read this have not undertaken any mandatory training.

A staff member left their laptop on the train while commuting home. Someone picked up the laptop, and they were able to gain access to it. Fortunately, the member of staff had reported it missing, and the laptop was remotely wiped. Chatter could not be sure if any data were accessed before the laptop was remotely wiped.

- Identify the legislation that is suitable for the governance practice in the company.
- Operational stages of the governance implementation
