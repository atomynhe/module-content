4. Suppose that amongst eight people each pair wants to be able to communicate securely without any risk of eavesdropping. 
   1. How many different keys will they need in total if they use a symmetric encryption algorithm and how many if they use an asymmetric encryption algorithm?
   2. How many keys does a person have to store secretly in both cases?
