# Cybersecurity Seminar 11 -- Security and Usability

1. Can you identify five security implementations in system design that is flawed and hinders usability.

2. One public face of the bank is its automatic teller machines. Authenticating transactions based on a customer’s card and personal identiﬁcation number -- in such a way as to defend against both outside and inside attack -- is harder than it looks! There have been many epidemics of *phantom withdrawals* in various countries when local villains (or bank staff) have found and exploited loopholes in the system. Automatic teller machines are also interesting as they were the ﬁrst large scale commercial use of cryptography, and they helped establish a number of crypto standards (Anderson, 2008).

   Identify loopholes in Automatic teller machines implementation that affects usability.

3. You have been employed as a security consultant in a software development project that is expected to operate on the web and desktop. Identify features that align with four discussed roles in this lesson.
