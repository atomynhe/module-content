# Cybersecurity Seminar 5 -- Trust

# Scenario 1

In June 2020, the company disclosed they had suffered a data breach after three employee email accounts were accessed by an unknown perpetrator who had been discovered in April 2020 but had been ongoing since May 2018. The compromised email accounts contained information on 28,268 patients' including patient names, dates of birth, contact information, healthcare information, insurance information, social security numbers, government identification numbers and/or financial account numbers.

An investigation showed that access was secured through social engineering to retrieve the authentication information from the staff. This attack has been on for two years without detection by the company.

1. Explain the contribution of trust to this attack.

2. Do you think sufficient authentication will prevent this attack?

3. Explain the type of authentication that you will implement to prevent future occurrence?
   - Justify your choices.

# Scenario 2

In March 2020, while the pandemic was capturing the world's attention, the company disclosed that in May 2019 they had discovered an "unsanctioned third party" had gained unauthorized access to employees' email accounts that contained personal information of employees and customers. The potentially exposed data included names, addresses, Social Security numbers, government-issued identification numbers, credit card and financial account information and health information.

The investigation of the attack pointed to two possible sources:

- Malware downloaded from personal laptops of staff

- Packet sniffing from the office wireless LAN
