# Cybersecurity Assessment

This assessment is worth 60% of the total module mark. It comprises of three separate reports, each worth 20% of the total module mark. Details of each report submission and the deadlines are provided below.

All three reports are based on the following scenario.

## Scenario

The University of Roehampton runs a number of systems to support the work of both staff and students. You have been asked to evaluate potential security threats to the university. The following key systems have been identified:

- Student Records System -- it contains information about all current students as well as students who have graduated in the past five years. This system is maintained on a database managed in the cloud.
- Human Resources (HR) System -- it contains information on all current employees at the university and anyone who has been employee in the past five years. The HR System also maintains information on anyone who has applied for a job in the last six months. This system is maintained by an external supplier.
- User Authentication System -- it contains information on users of the university IT systems. It gathers information from the Student Records System and the HR System to maintain who should have login to the university IT systems, and the level of access they have. This system is maintained in the cloud.
- Moodle -- it contains teaching material for all modules and programmes delivered by the university, and supports the running of assessments. Users login using the credentials supplied by the User Authentication System. The Student Records System defines which students should have access to which areas of Moodle. User email addresses are also accessible via Moodle. This system is painted by an external supplier, different to the HR System.
- SharePoint -- it contains most of office files (e.g., Word, Excel) used by the university. Access to SharePoint is managed via the User Authentication System. Users can access different areas based on the level of access. Users can also share files via SharePoint, and synchronise areas of SharePoint in their local OneDrive folders. The university Student Portal also runs from SharePoint. This system is maintained in the cloud.

The following key processes have also been identified:

- Student Recruitment -- most undergraduate students apply for a course via UCAS (the central UK university application system). UCAS forwards data onto the university when an application is made. MSc and overseas students normally use a system integrated into the Student Records System.
- Student Registration -- when students fully register for their course, they must enter their personal details into a system integrated into the Student Records System.
- Staff Appointment -- when a member of staff is appointed, a member of HR enters their details into the HR System from their application form. The new line manager requests login details from IT separately.
- Staff Leaving -- when a member of staff leaves the university, a member of HR will update their record accordingly. The line manager should request the login details be terminated.
- Assessment -- when students submit assessment, marks are entered within Moodle to share directly with the students. For exam boards, lecturers extract the marks from Moodle into an Excel spreadsheet stored on SharePoint. These marks are then entered into the Student Records System by a member of the Academic Services Team.

## Report One

**This report covers the learning outcome *Investigate measures that can be taken by both individuals and organizations including governments to prevent or mitigate the undesirable effects of computer crimes and identity theft.***

The university has asked you to analyse their current systems and processes as defined above and identify potential risks from computer crime. They have asked for a four page report providing the following information:

- Any risks of computer crime to the systems defined above.
- Any risks of computer crime to the processes defined above.
- What measures should the university take to mitigate the risks you have identified.

You will need to create a formal business report with everything compiled into a single document (PDF). The report should use 12-point font in Times New Roman, 1-inch margins, and single line spaced. The report should be properly paged, paragraphed, and sectioned, and include the following sections in order.

1. An introduction to the report, providing its context and motivation.
2. Risks identified for each system defined, detailing why it is a risk.
3. Risks identified for each process defined, detailing why it is a risk.
4. Recommended measures the university should take and how it addresses each of the risks.

The report must be a maximum of four pages.

It is highly recommended that you review the following chapters in the essential course text *Security for Software Engineers* by James N. Helfrich to support your work. The book is available from the library:

- Chapter 02: Classification of Attacks.
- Chapter 04: Social Engineering.
- Chapter 10: Authentication.
- Chapter 11: Access Control.

### Marking Scheme

The following rubric will be used to grade the report.

| **Criteria**                                                 | **Excellent**                                                | **Satisfactory**                                             | **Not Satisfactory**                                         | **Not attempted**                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Presentation** how well organised is the report.           | Good organisation, points are logically ordered, report order flows together. | Organised, although some points are somewhat jumpy. General flow of report works. | Some organisation points jump around. Flow is unclear.       | Poorly organised. No logical progression. Overall flow is vague. |
| **Discussion** overall level of discussion in the report.    | Excellent overall level of discussion provided.              | Good discussion level provided although unclear or inconsistent in a couple of places. | Discussion is good but lacks clarity and consistency in places. | Discussion is poor and does not provide clarity to the report. |
| **Quality of information** ability to provide details to support the report. | Supporting details specific to subject.                      | Some details are non-supporting to the subject.              | Details are somewhat unclear and do not support the topic.   | Specific details undefined or difficult to find.             |
| **Risks identified** quality and completeness of the risks identified in the report. | Excellent range of risks identified and clearly described.   | Range of risks covers the most obvious ones, and description is generally clear. | Some clear risks not covered and/or level of description is unclear. | No risks identified, or types of risk identified are not suitable for the scenario. |
| **Recommendations** quality and completeness of the recommendations made in the report. | Recommend measures summarises and draws clear, effective methods to address risks identified. | Recommended measures summarises methods although some further clarity on effectiveness is required. | Recommended measures are only remotely related to the risks described. | No recommended measures provided, or measures are inappropriate to the risks identified. |
| **Format** ability to meet the formatting standard defined.  | Report is in the correct format.                             | Report is mostly in the correct format                       | Report has a few formatting issues.                          | Report has many formatting issues or does not meet the guidelines specified. |
