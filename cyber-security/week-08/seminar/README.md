# Cybersecurity Seminar 08 -- Cryptography

## Scenario 1

The Salvation Army in the UK supports flexible working from home using laptops owned by the charity, but says finding a good way of protecting data was a challenge.

"Media coverage focusing on the downside to flexible working practices, where employees may leave laptops on trains or in their car boots to be easy targets for thieves, has underlined the threat of data leakage and provided a solid business case for investing in a secure network," said Neil Edmonds, IT operations manager at the charity.

The Salvation Army's IT department is responsible for supporting 7,000 users and 18 divisions across the UK and Ireland operation including the territorial headquarters, regional offices, social and community care centres and numerous remote workers.

As the head of the Charity's IT department, can you define the details of the cryptography package that should be adopted. This should include the type and the platform of implementation. Provide justification for your answer.

## Scenario 2

Launchpad is a charity that provide warehouse services for charities that helps some of Reading’s most vulnerable and disadvantaged people to turn their lives around and fulfil their potential. Launchpad began by running a soup kitchen 35 years ago and were previously known as ‘Reading’s Single Homeless Project’ until 2011. Today, they are known as Launchpad Reading.

Due to the nature of their business and the sensitive data they hold (and despite having good security measures already in place), Launchpad Reading were very nervous of losing company and client data. Their infrastructure include laptops, servers, USBs and Personal Computers. 

Suggest a cryptography Scheme for the company.
