## Computing MSc Project Handbook

## Introduction

This handbook has been produced to guide your journey through the MSc Project process. It intends to provide a foundation to support your project being successful. However, you must understand that your project is your own. Your supervisor and the rest of the academic team will support your journey, but it is your responsibility to bring the project to completion -- and gain the award of an MSc.

## Overview of the Project

The MSc Project is a substantial piece of independent work that demonstrates that you have developed the necessary skills to produce a significant project in your subject area. The project involves the research, design, implementation, and evaluation of an artefact. This artefact addresses a particular problem relevant to your degree area.

The MSc Project is the most important part of your degree. It is worth 60 credits which equates to a third of your entire degree of study. You should plan to dedicate 600 hours of work to your MSc Project.

The MSc Project gives you the opportunity to demonstrate the abilities and pursue your academic interests in a piece of individual work, integrating and building upon concepts from your degree, carry out research, and acquire and practice skills and expertise beyond those you are directly taught.

Your project poses different problems than those you face in your taught modules:

1. You will have to select your project topic -- you need to have a specific interest in computing that you want to pursue.
2. The deadline is of the project is many weeks after the start, and you need to manage your productivity. Do not leave work too late, or keep putting it off. People refer to this as time management problems, but really it is an organisation and motivation problem.
3. You have to develop a plan to deliver your project, including all its deliverables. Your plan will evolve with the project, but you need to return to your plan and update it. Planning is more important than sticking to the plan.
4. You are assessed on your ability to critically evaluate your work, other solutions to solving the problem, produce a substantial artefact, and demonstrate awareness of the context of your work (e.g., published work, technology alternatives).

## Learning Outcomes

The MSc Project has the following learning outcomes:

1. Self-manage a significant piece of individual work using appropriate project management techniques.
2. Synthesise information, ideas, and practices to define a quality solution to a problem.
3. Apply practical and analytical skills present in computer science as a whole.
4. Produce a project deliverable that meets a real need in a wider context.
5. Critical self-evaluation of the overall project process and deliverables.
6. Recognise the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues relevant to a project.
7. Produce a report that describes and summarises the entire project deliverable and process, including evaluation.

You will be assessed against these learning outcomes.

## Project Deliverables

Your project has three main deliverables.

- The project report -- a rough outline of the contents of the report is provided below.
- Any required deliverables, such as software products produced. These should be made available in a manner such that the examination team can access them easily.
- A short screencast illustrating the work they have done. This can be just a short PowerPoint recording with you talking behind it. Or, it can be a technical walkthrough of your product while you explain the features. **The screencast must be approximately five to ten minutes long. If it is significantly longer or shorter this will impact the final grade of your project.**

## Selecting Your Project

Selecting a project is your first major task. There are a few things you need to take into consideration:

- The type of project you will undertake.
- What makes a project valid.
- Your programme of study.

### Project Types

There are four types of project that you can undertake:

1. Academic defined.
2. Industry defined.
3. Self defined.
4. Social enterprise.

#### Academic Defined

An academic defined project is perhaps the most common. This is where you undertake a project defined by a member of the academic team. There can be two types of academic project:

1. Research based -- this is where you work with the academic on a project related to their area of interest. This will require an investigation based on the research area in question, and typically using a research method defined in the field. These projects are good for those of you wishing to further pursue an academic career in a specific discipline.
2. Build based -- academics often come up with project ideas for various reasons. Areas of potential interest, support of some other work they are doing (including teaching), or just to give some project ideas to students. These projects are typically less research orientated and more about building an artefact or undertaking a study of some kind.

The academic involved will typically be your project supervisor.

#### Industry Defined

If you have some industry contacts or know someone with a particular problem from a commercial sector, then you may be able to use this as a project (although see below about what makes a valid project). Your industry contact acts as a stakeholder for your project, although they cannot be a member of the supervisory team.

#### Self Defined

You may have your own idea of what you want to do for your project. This is good as you will have more motivation to complete it -- but see below about what makes a valid project. A self defined project is also very common. You will work with a member of the academic team to ensure that your project is of a suitable style and scope.

#### Social Enterprise

A social enterprise project is where your work aims to do something that is aimed at social good over specific commercial goals. A social enterprise project looks in many regards like an industry defined project or a self defined project. However, typically in a social enterprise project you are hoping to solve a particular problem for social good. This will drive the type of evaluation you will do as you will need to assess how well your project has met its aims in the context of these societal issues.

### Valid Projects

A project has to be approved by the academic team. This is to ensure that:

1. Your project is an appropriate scope for an MSc project.
2. Your project meets the professional body standards.
3. Your project meets the requirements of your programme.

The first and third points you will find support from project supervisor, your programme convenor, and the academic team. The second point you can find more about below.

#### BCS Project Requirements

The BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, is the professional body of the IT industry. The BCS is the accrediting body for computing courses in the UK and elsewhere in the world. The BCS is also a signatory on the Seoul Accord, an international agreement on computing degree standards, including the USA, Canada, Japan, Korea, and Australia. Therefore, the BCS project requirements are not only meeting UK standards, but international standards.

The BCS accreditation requirements specify the expectations of a project in a computing degree.

> Projects must include the students undertaking practical work of some sort using computing/IT technology. This is most frequently achieved by the creation of an artefact as the focus for covering all or part of an implementation lifecycle. Dissertations based solely on literature review activity and/or user/market surveys are not acceptable.

As you can see, there is a requirement that practical work is undertaken and typically this means the production of an artefact. The BCS provides further guidance based on whether your degree is a specialist masters or a generalist masters. Details are provided below, but briefly, specialist masters students are expected to work on research inspired projects from their degree, and generalist masters on projects focused on building artefacts in a more general case.

##### Specialist Masters

For a specialist masters project, the student is expected to demonstrate the following:

- a systematic understanding of knowledge, and a critical awareness of current problems and/or new insights, much of which is at, or informed by, the forefront of the specialist academic discipline
- a comprehensive understanding of techniques applicable to their own research or advanced scholarship
- originality in the application of knowledge, together with a practical understanding of how established techniques of research and enquiry are used to create and interpret knowledge in the discipline
- deal with complex issues both systematically and creatively, make sound judgements in the absence of complete data, and communicate their conclusions clearly to specialist and non-specialist audiences
- demonstrate self-direction and originality in tackling and solving problems, and act autonomously in planning and implementing tasks at a professional or equivalent level
- critical self-evaluation of the process

##### Generalist (Conversion) Masters

For a generalist masters project, the student is expected to demonstrate the following:

- their ability to apply practical and analytical skills present in the programme as a whole
- innovation and/or creativity
- synthesis of information, ideas and practices to provide a quality solution together with an evaluation of that solution
- that their project meets a real need in a wider context
- the ability to self-manage a significant piece of work
- critical self-evaluation of the process

### Project Types by Programme

Your project requires you to investigate, design, implement, and evaluate an artefact for a particular problem relevant to your degree of study. Put simply, you must develop something related to a problem in your discipline area.

The artefact will be built and/or written to meet your programme requirements. For example, a software library can be considered a build artefact for software development projects, and the API documentation produced would be written content.

Below provides the guidance for each specific programme area.

#### MSc Computing

MSc Computing is a broad conversion degree, and therefore the project must investigate a computing problem/area. Typically, this will be in the development of a software artefact and suitable critical evaluation of the technologies and/or methods used in the investigation and/or build.

The developed artefact should be large enough to demonstrate the meeting of the programme learning outcomes. Possible artefacts include, but are not limited to:

- Algorithms.
- Database applications.
- Mobile applications.
- Desktop applications.
- Web applications.
- Websites.
- Software prototypes.
- Simulations/simulators.

## Project Process

The MSc Project occurs during any term so giving specific dates is difficult. The following provides a rough outline for the project. Specific dates will be shared via Moodle and your timetable.

### ==Support Workshops==

The project team run four support workshops to help you along the journey of your project.

**TO DO**



·    Problem elucidation and objective setting.

·    How to perform an investigation into the literature and context of a project.

·    How to conduct an evaluation.

·    How to deliver a significant piece of written work.



### ==Supervisory Team==

### ==Lifecycle==



**TO DO**



#### ==Project Initiation==



#### ==Progress Review==



#### ==Delivery==



#### ==Oral Examination==



### Milestones

You have three submissions as part of the project. These are designed to ensure you have started your project and are making sufficient progress, as well as providing opportunities for feedback. Note that these weeks are approximate and actual dates will be provided on Moodle and subject to supervisory team availability.

- Week 1: Project initiation and sign off -- you must provide a brief overview of your proposal and the name of your proposed supervisor.
- Week 5: Progress review -- you must provide a short overview of the outcome of your investigation, any particular work you have undertaken in implementation or results gathering, and a concrete plan for how you will deliver the project by the deadline.
- Week 6: Progress review meeting -- your supervisory team will meet with you to discuss your progress. The second marker will provide feedback, specifically as they are detached from the project process. This will provide you with an external viewpoint of how things are going.
- Week 15: Project delivery -- your report and other supporting artefacts are submitted via Moodle.
- Week 18: Oral examination -- this is your chance to discuss your project and explain to your supervisors what you have achieved. Some points to note:
  - This is not an interrogation -- it is a collegiate discussion and feedback session.
  - This is a chance to talk about your project -- perhaps your only chance. Show why you found it exciting.
  - Your second marker has only really read some documents from you and may not understand your project. This is your chance to explain things here.
  - Really, the oral examination normally results in your grade increasing as your markers get a better picture of the work you have done.

## ==Report Format and Requirements==



**TO DO**



### Report Requirements

BCS accreditation criteria state that projects must produce a report which includes:

- elucidation of the problem and the objectives of the project
- an in-depth investigation of the context and literature, and where appropriate, other similar products
- where appropriate, a clear description of the stages of the life cycle undertaken
- where appropriate, a description of how verification and validation were applied at these stages
- where appropriate, a description of the use of tools to support the development process
- a critical appraisal of the project, indicating the rationale for any design/implementation decisions, lessons learnt during the course of the project, and evaluation (with hindsight) of the project outcome and the process of its production (including a review of the plan and any deviations from it)
- a description of any research hypothesis
- in the event that the individual work is part of a group enterprise, a clear indication of the part played by the author in achieving the goals of the project and its effectiveness
- references

### Report Structure

Although every project is unique, there is a common structure to MSc Project reports, with some variability in the middle. Fundamentally, the report has four sections:

- Front Matter
- Main Body
- References
- Appendices

#### Front Matter

The front matter of the report is a common set of pages that provide the gateway to the work presented. You should not number the sections of the introductory information. The pages are normally numbered using Roman numerals excluding the Title Page.

##### Title Page

A standard report title page will be made available that you must use as the cover of the report. This page is not numbered.

##### Abstract

The abstract summarises your work giving the reader with an overview of the project. It is meant to persuade people to read the project or not based on the content within it.

Abstracts are approximately 300 words and no more than 500 words (about half a page to a full page). It should explain:

- The aims of the project.
- How the aims were achieved.

The abstract is typically written last. You should review some academic papers for examples of the style and format of an abstract.

##### Declaration

You must attach the declaration sheet provided. You must complete, date, and sign the dissertation declaration and sign the own work declaration before submission.

##### Acknowledgements

It is common to acknowledge people who have supported you during the project, either in terms of knowledge, equipment, or support. This is your chance to formally acknowledge the people who have helped you in your work. This page is not essential, but it is normal practice to acknowledge your supervisor and any other staff who have supported you.

##### Table of Contents

The sections and subsections of the main body are listed with their page numbers. References and appendices are also number.

#### Main Body

The main part of the report. Each section should be numbered using Arabic (standard) numerals. The introduction should start at page 1.

The structure of the main body will somewhat vary based on the nature of the project. However, there is a general flow through the project, with additional sections added as necessary.

- Introduction to the project.
- The legal, social, ethical and professional issues relevant to the project.
- The structure then varies based on whether the project is build-orientated or research-orientated:
  - Research Orientated:
    - An investigation, generally driven by a search and review of relevant literature.
    - A methodology defining how you will undertake your research.
    - The results from performing the research methodology.
    - Discussion of the results and what they tell us about your area of research.
  - Build Orientated:
    - A review into the background of the work, which can be driven by technology, literature, and other resources.
    - A design of the artefact to be built.
    - Details of the implementation of the artefact.
    - An evaluation of your artefact to objectively determine its quality.
- A conclusion to the report, summarising the findings, discussing related work, and any future work.

**It is, however, up to you how to structure your project and the contents of these sections. This guidance lets you know what we expect and what is likely to provide you with the most success.**

The main body has a **maximum** word count limit of 10,000 words. Organising the writing of your report is one of the signifiant challenges you will face. Some suggestions on how to organise and write the main body are:

- Early in the project, plan the sections and an estimated size. This will help you keep within the word count.
- Start writing early. Ask for feedback from your supervisor. And don't write from page 1 -- the biggest obstacle is staring at the first blank page and wondering how to start. Write up parts of your work as you do them.
- You are writing your report for your examiners first and foremost. They will use the assessment criteria defined here. Importantly, it is expected that you use a formal, academic writing style relevant to the discipline. Your supervisor can help here by giving you feedback on your early writing.

##### Introduction

This section should introduce the work. Depending on the nature of the project, you might have the following parts:

- An initial paragraph introducing the project context and idea (all projects).
- A hypothesis and/or research question(s) (research based projects)
- Aims of the project (all projects)
  - Aims are broad statements of desired outcomes and intentions.
- Objectives of the project (all projects)
  - Tangible steps that will be taken to achieve the aims -- tasks that will be done.
- Breakdown of the rest of the report (all projects)
  - Describe the upcoming sections in order -- this provides your reader with a roadmap of the report.

##### Legal, Social, Ethical, and Professional Issues

Your project must include a description of the legal, social, ethical and professional issues relevant to the project. **All projects will have either a legal, social, ethical or professional issue element.** You must discuss these here and highlight any issues that had to be addressed before undertaking the project.

If your project required ethical clearance, then this must be clearly stated in this section, including how the ethical considerations were managed.

##### Background

You need to convince your examination team that your project is a viable one by answering the question -- **why is this a suitable project for a MSc Project?**

The aim of the background section is to provide the reader with the relevant contextual information necessary to understand your work. This section must be suitably referenced based on the reviews undertaken. There are two reviews that are likely to take place within this section -- a technology review and a literature review. The section concludes with a summary of the findings from the background investigation and how that **justifies** the work undertaken in your project.

###### Technology Review

The technology review focuses on technology that will be and could be used for the project. Typically, it is expected that you have reviewed different technology options for your project and summarised these options here. It should be clear why the technology choices taken were made.

###### Literature Review

All projects should reference some academic literature, although it is primarily research orientated projects that will conduct a significant literature review in the background section. As with the technology review, the goal here is to make it clear why the choices were made in the project. It is expected that at least the research methodology and/or evaluation approach are defined from existing sources.

##### Design or Methodology

Now you must tell your examination team what you are going by answering the question -- **how are you going to undertake the project?**

The aim of this section is to explain to your reader the work you are going to undertake. Depending on whether the project is more build or research focused, this section can take one of the following forms.

###### Design

If your project is a build focused project, you should provide a design for what your project will build. The nature of this design will depend on your project, but it should provide a complete idea of what you are going to build, including the technologies to be used.

###### Methodology

If your project is research focused, then you need to define the particular research methodology you are using to gather and assess data. Typically, this will involve some sort of data gathering process and statistical analysis of results. However, you should also describe the tools (e.g., technologies) that you will use as well.

###### Alternative Approaches

Another important point in this section is to document any alternative approaches you could have taken to complete the project. For example, were there different technology choices, design choices, or methodological choices you could have taken? You should explain why you have taken the approach you have taken rather than these alternatives.

##### Implementation or Results

Once the examination team what you planned to do, you must tell them what happened -- **what was the outcome of the work you undertook in the project?**

A build project will discuss the implementation. **Do not just paste in lines of code to your report and call that an implementation! Your report should feature minimum code to only discuss points.** The idea for an implementation is to describe how the design has actually turned out.

A research project will present the results from performing the methodology. These results must be correctly presented, using appropriate tables, charts, and statistical tests that suit the nature of the project. Results should be summarised and any findings clearly presented.

##### Evaluation

The examination team now need to know how well the project went -- **how good was the outcome from the project?**

Evaluation is an important element of any project. You must tell your reader how good the final deliverable is. **Your project does not have to be perfect -- indeed the outcomes might have been bad.** The point is you must evaluate the outcome and discuss its strengths and weaknesses.

A key element of this section is a reflection on the aims and objectives set out at the start of the project, and how well these have been met. **Again, it is possible not to achieve an aim or objective.** The point is you evaluate how well you did meet your goals.

###### Related Work

Answer the question -- **who else has done something similar and how does my work compare?**

Another key element of this section is evaluating your work against that of others. How good is your work when compared to other people who have undertake similar work? It is important to be able to understand how well you have achieved your goals in relation to others, while also considering the time limitations of the project.

##### Conclusion

The conclusion summarises the project. You need to highlight your key outputs and/or discoveries. There are some particular subsections that must appear in your conclusion.

###### Reflection

You must critically reflect on the entire project process and how well you have worked on the project. What particular things have you learned during the project? Why were you able and unable to meet project goals? What would have you done differently in hindsight?

A common approach many students take in this section is to claim poor time management. **Poor time management is rarely a problem unless you had too much to do in the project.** Normally, what is called poor time management is poor organisation, planning, and motivation. Being honest in your reflection will help you understand how you can improve these issues rather than focusing on time management issues.

###### Future Work

Answer the question -- **what next?**

You've completed a significant piece of work -- perhaps the largest piece of work you have ever done. But no project is ever 100% complete, and you will have found new ideas alone the way. If someone were to pick up your project, what avenues should be explored next.

#### References

In this section you **must** reference any sources used in your work. Typically, these sources will have come up during the investigation and related work sections. Your referencing must use the IEEE referencing style [IEEE Citation Guidelines2.doc (ieee-dataport.org)](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE Citation Guidelines.pdf).

It is **highly** recommended that you use reference management software such as Mendeley or Zotero.

Many students ask how many references are required. That is like asking how long a piece of string is. Your project should have as many references as is required for it. However, having few references indicates that no thorough investigation has occurred.

#### Appendices

Appendices appear after references. Your appendices depend on the nature of your project. **Do not assume people will read your appendices.** Even if you direct them to do so in your main text, appendices are considered additional information and should not be relied upon to understand your main body of work. Refer readers to an appendix using a phrase such as *see Appendix A for further details*.

The following documents **must** be included as references:

- Your Project Proposal.
- Your Progress Review Form.
- Your original plan and revised plans as your project evolved.
- A description of how to access any technical output. **It is strongly recommended you use GitHub or similar to do this.**
- Any important communications between you and external stakeholders -- **please ensure private data is removed and communications anonymised.**

### ==Academic Misconduct==

**Plagiarism** is a serious offence in academic work. This is where you present work of another as your own. It includes, but is not limited to, the copying from other students, books, the Internet, or other sources.

You may be accused of academic misconduct if you:

- Use an author's exact works without given appropriate attribution (a reference).
- Write about another person's ideas without giving appropriate attribution.
- Modify too little of a source even when giving appropriate attribution.
- Presenting a collection of others' ideas without appropriate attribution.
- Copy another student's work. If you lend you work to another, both of you can be penalised for academic misconduct.
- Have someone else complete your work for.
- Submit work already submitted for another assessment.

You can avoid many plagiarism issues by being diligent in your approach to your work:

- Recording all the appropriate references when you make notes. **Use reference management software as far as possible.**
- Ensure your notes are not copies -- rewrite ideas in your own words.
- Paraphrase paragraphs and not sentences.
- When you write, even a draft, add the appropriate reference.
- Collaborating means sharing ideas, not written work or code.
- Read as widely as you can to see how other authors avoid plagiarism.



### Failed Projects

The pass mark for the MSc Project is 50%.

Students who fail the project at the first attempt are normally given the opportunity to **resubmit the project next term with the mark capped at 50%.** This is not a new project, but a resubmission of your project addressing the areas of weakness as fed back by the examination team. You will have to undertake the following steps:

- Resubmission of the report addressing the issues raised, perhaps including additional technical work.
- Resubmission of the video presentation if new technical work has been delivered.
- A further oral presentation.

### Student Support

Your first points of contact during your project should be:

- Your supervisor.
- Your Academic Guidance Tutor (AGT).
- Your Programme Convenor.
- Your Programme Administrator.

If you have any additional support needs, please ensure that you contact the Student Wellbeing Team [Student Support: Wellbeing Support | University of Roehampton](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/student-support/wellbeing-support/).

General academic support is provided by the Academic Achievement Team via the Library [Academic Achievement - Library Home at University of Roehampton](https://library.roehampton.ac.uk/prf.php?account_id=140270).

If you are experiencing technical difficulties when submitting your work you must contact the IT Service Desk immediately before the deadline [ServiceDesk | University of Roehampton](https://www.roehampton.ac.uk/current-students/servicedesk/).
