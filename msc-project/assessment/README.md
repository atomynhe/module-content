## Computing MSc Project Handbook

## Introduction

This handbook has been produced to guide your journey through the MSc Project process. It intends to provide a foundation to support your project being successful. However, you must understand that your project is your own. Your supervisor and the rest of the academic team will support your journey, but it is your responsibility to bring the project to completion -- and gain the award of an MSc.
