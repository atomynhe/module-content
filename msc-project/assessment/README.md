## Computing MSc Project Handbook

## Introduction

This handbook has been produced to guide your journey through the MSc Project process. It intends to provide a foundation to support your project being successful. However, you must understand that your project is your own. Your supervisor and the rest of the academic team will support your journey, but it is your responsibility to bring the project to completion -- and gain the award of an MSc.

## Learning Outcomes

1. Self-manage a significant piece of individual work using appropriate project management techniques.
2. Synthesise information, ideas, and practices to define a quality solution to a problem.
3. Apply practical and analytical skills present in computer science as a whole.
4. Produce a project deliverable that meets a real need in a wider context.
5. Critical self-evaluation of the overall project process and deliverables.
6. Recognise the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues relevant to a project.
7. Produce a report that describes and summarises the entire project deliverable and process, including evaluation.

## Project Deliverables

## Selecting Your Process

## Project Types

### Academic Defined

### Industry Defined

### Self Defined

### Social Enterprise

## British Computer Society Project Requirements

> Projects must include the students undertaking practical work of some sort using computing/IT technology. This is most frequently achieved by the creation of an artefact as the focus for covering all or part of an implementation lifecycle. Dissertations based solely on literature review activity and/or user/market surveys are not acceptable.

### Report

BCS accreditation criteria state that projects must produce a report which includes:

- elucidation of the problem and the objectives of the project
- an in-depth investigation of the context and literature, and where appropriate, other similar products
- where appropriate, a clear description of the stages of the life cycle undertaken
- where appropriate, a description of how verification and validation were applied at these stages
- where appropriate, a description of the use of tools to support the development process
- a critical appraisal of the project, indicating the rationale for any design/implementation decisions, lessons learnt during the course of the project, and evaluation (with hindsight) of the project outcome and the process of its production (including a review of the plan and any deviations from it)
- a description of any research hypothesis
- in the event that the individual work is part of a group enterprise, a clear indication of the part played by the author in achieving the goals of the project and its effectiveness
- references

### Specialist Masters

- a systematic understanding of knowledge, and a critical awareness of current problems and/or new insights, much of which is at, or informed by, the forefront of the specialist academic discipline
- a comprehensive understanding of techniques applicable to their own research or advanced scholarship
- originality in the application of knowledge, together with a practical understanding of how established techniques of research and enquiry are used to create and interpret knowledge in the discipline
- deal with complex issues both systematically and creatively, make sound judgements in the absence of complete data, and communicate their conclusions clearly to specialist and non-specialist audiences
- demonstrate self-direction and originality in tackling and solving problems, and act autonomously in planning and implementing tasks at a professional or equivalent level
- critical self-evaluation of the process

### Generalist (Conversion) Masters

- their ability to apply practical and analytical skills present in the programme as a whole
- innovation and/or creativity
- synthesis of information, ideas and practices to provide a quality solution together with an evaluation of that solution
- that their project meets a real need in a wider context
- the ability to self-manage a significant piece of work
- critical self-evaluation of the process
