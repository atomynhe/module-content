## Computing MSc Project Handbook

## Introduction

This handbook has been produced to guide your journey through the MSc Project process. It intends to provide a foundation to support your project being successful. However, you must understand that your project is your own. Your supervisor and the rest of the academic team will support your journey, but it is your responsibility to bring the project to completion -- and gain the award of an MSc.

## Overview of the Project

The MSc Project is a substantial piece of independent work that demonstrates that you have developed the necessary skills to produce a significant project in your subject area. The project involves the research, design, implementation, and evaluation of an artefact. This artefact addresses a particular problem relevant to your degree area.

The MSc Project is the most important part of your degree. It is worth 60 credits which equates to a third of your entire degree of study. You should plan to dedicate 600 hours of work to your MSc Project.

The MSc Project gives you the opportunity to demonstrate the abilities and pursue your academic interests in a piece of individual work, integrating and building upon concepts from your degree, carry out research, and acquire and practice skills and expertise beyond those you are directly taught.

Your project poses different problems than those you face in your taught modules:

1. You will have to select your project topic -- you need to have a specific interest in computing that you want to pursue.
2. The deadline is of the project is many weeks after the start, and you need to manage your productivity. Do not leave work too late, or keep putting it off. People refer to this as time management problems, but really it is an organisation and motivation problem.
3. You have to develop a plan to deliver your project, including all its deliverables. Your plan will evolve with the project, but you need to return to your plan and update it. Planning is more important than sticking to the plan.
4. You are assessed on your ability to critically evaluate your work, other solutions to solving the problem, produce a substantial artefact, and demonstrate awareness of the context of your work (e.g., published work, technology alternatives).

## Learning Outcomes

The MSc Project has the following learning outcomes:

1. Self-manage a significant piece of individual work using appropriate project management techniques.
2. Synthesise information, ideas, and practices to define a quality solution to a problem.
3. Apply practical and analytical skills present in computer science as a whole.
4. Produce a project deliverable that meets a real need in a wider context.
5. Critical self-evaluation of the overall project process and deliverables.
6. Recognise the legal, social, ethical, and professional issues relevant to a project.
7. Produce a report that describes and summarises the entire project deliverable and process, including evaluation.

You will be assessed against these learning outcomes.

**TO DO**



## Selecting Your Project

Selecting a project is your first major task. There are a few things you need to take into consideration:

- The type of project you will undertake.
- What makes a project valid.
- Your programme of study.

### Project Types

There are four types of project that you can undertake:

1. Academic defined.
2. Industry defined.
3. Self defined.
4. Social enterprise.

#### Academic Defined

An academic defined project is perhaps the most common. This is where you undertake a project defined by a member of the academic team. There can be two types of academic project:

1. Research based -- this is where you work with the academic on a project related to their area of interest. This will require an investigation based on the research area in question, and typically using a research method defined in the field. These projects are good for those of you wishing to further pursue an academic career in a specific discipline.
2. Build based -- academics often come up with project ideas for various reasons. Areas of potential interest, support of some other work they are doing (including teaching), or just to give some project ideas to students. These projects are typically less research orientated and more about building an artefact or undertaking a study of some kind.

The academic involved will typically be your project supervisor.

#### Industry Defined

If you have some industry contacts or know someone with a particular problem from a commercial sector, then you may be able to use this as a project (although see below about what makes a valid project). Your industry contact acts as a stakeholder for your project, although they cannot be a member of the supervisory team.

#### Self Defined

You may have your own idea of what you want to do for your project. This is good as you will have more motivation to complete it -- but see below about what makes a valid project. A self defined project is also very common. You will work with a member of the academic team to ensure that your project is of a suitable style and scope.

#### Social Enterprise

A social enterprise project is where your work aims to do something that is aimed at social good over specific commercial goals. A social enterprise project looks in many regards like an industry defined project or a self defined project. However, typically in a social enterprise project you are hoping to solve a particular problem for social good. This will drive the type of evaluation you will do as you will need to assess how well your project has met its aims in the context of these societal issues.

### Valid Projects

A project has to be approved by the academic team. This is to ensure that:

1. Your project is an appropriate scope for an MSc project.
2. Your project meets the professional body standards.
3. Your project meets the requirements of your programme.

The first and third points you will find support from project supervisor, your programme convenor, and the academic team. The second point you can find more about below.

#### BCS Project Requirements

The BCS, the Chartered Institute for IT, is the professional body of the IT industry. The BCS is the accrediting body for computing courses in the UK and elsewhere in the world. The BCS is also a signatory on the Seoul Accord, an international agreement on computing degree standards, including the USA, Canada, Japan, Korea, and Australia. Therefore, the BCS project requirements are not only meeting UK standards, but international standards.

The BCS accreditation requirements specify the expectations of a project in a computing degree.

> Projects must include the students undertaking practical work of some sort using computing/IT technology. This is most frequently achieved by the creation of an artefact as the focus for covering all or part of an implementation lifecycle. Dissertations based solely on literature review activity and/or user/market surveys are not acceptable.

As you can see, there is a requirement that practical work is undertaken and typically this means the production of an artefact. The BCS provides further guidance based on whether your degree is a specialist masters or a generalist masters. Details are provided below, but briefly, specialist masters students are expected to work on research inspired projects from their degree, and generalist masters on projects focused on building artefacts in a more general case.

##### Specialist Masters

For a specialist masters project, the student is expected to demonstrate the following:

- a systematic understanding of knowledge, and a critical awareness of current problems and/or new insights, much of which is at, or informed by, the forefront of the specialist academic discipline
- a comprehensive understanding of techniques applicable to their own research or advanced scholarship
- originality in the application of knowledge, together with a practical understanding of how established techniques of research and enquiry are used to create and interpret knowledge in the discipline
- deal with complex issues both systematically and creatively, make sound judgements in the absence of complete data, and communicate their conclusions clearly to specialist and non-specialist audiences
- demonstrate self-direction and originality in tackling and solving problems, and act autonomously in planning and implementing tasks at a professional or equivalent level
- critical self-evaluation of the process

##### Generalist (Conversion) Masters

For a generalist masters project, the student is expected to demonstrate the following:

- their ability to apply practical and analytical skills present in the programme as a whole
- innovation and/or creativity
- synthesis of information, ideas and practices to provide a quality solution together with an evaluation of that solution
- that their project meets a real need in a wider context
- the ability to self-manage a significant piece of work
- critical self-evaluation of the process

### Report Requirements

BCS accreditation criteria state that projects must produce a report which includes:

- elucidation of the problem and the objectives of the project
- an in-depth investigation of the context and literature, and where appropriate, other similar products
- where appropriate, a clear description of the stages of the life cycle undertaken
- where appropriate, a description of how verification and validation were applied at these stages
- where appropriate, a description of the use of tools to support the development process
- a critical appraisal of the project, indicating the rationale for any design/implementation decisions, lessons learnt during the course of the project, and evaluation (with hindsight) of the project outcome and the process of its production (including a review of the plan and any deviations from it)
- a description of any research hypothesis
- in the event that the individual work is part of a group enterprise, a clear indication of the part played by the author in achieving the goals of the project and its effectiveness

### Report Structure

Although every project is unique, there is a common structure to MSc Project reports, with some variability in the middle. Fundamentally, the report has four sections:

- Front Matter
- Main Body
- References
- Appendices

#### Front Matter

The front matter of the report is a common set of pages that provide the gateway to the work presented. You should not number the sections of the introductory information. The pages are normally numbered using Roman numerals excluding the Title Page.

##### Title Page

A standard report title page will be made available that you must use as the cover of the report. This page is not numbered.

##### Abstract

The abstract summarises your work giving the reader with an overview of the project. It is meant to persuade people to read the project or not based on the content within it.

Abstracts are approximately 300 words and no more than 500 words (about half a page to a full page). It should explain:

- The aims of the project.
- How the aims were achieved.

The abstract is typically written last. You should review some academic papers for examples of the style and format of an abstract.

##### Declaration

You must attach the declaration sheet provided. You must complete, date, and sign the dissertation declaration and sign the own work declaration before submission.

##### Acknowledgements

It is common to acknowledge people who have supported you during the project, either in terms of knowledge, equipment, or support. This is your chance to formally acknowledge the people who have helped you in your work. This page is not essential, but it is normal practice to acknowledge your supervisor and any other staff who have supported you.

##### Table of Contents

The sections and subsections of the main body are listed with their page numbers. References and appendices are also number.

#### Main Body

The main part of the report. Each section should be numbered using Arabic (standard) numerals. The introduction should start at page 1.

The structure of the main body will somewhat vary based on the nature of the project. However, there is a general flow through the project, with additional sections added as necessary.

1. Introduction to the project.
2. The legal, social, ethical and professional issues relevant to the project.
3. The structure then varies based on whether the project is build-orientated or research-orientated:
   - Research Orientated:
     4. An investigation, generally driven by a search and review of relevant literature.
     5. A methodology defining how you will undertake your research.
     6. The results from performing the research methodology.
     7. Discussion of the results and what they tell us about your area of research.
   - Build Orientated:
     4. A review into the background of the work, which can be driven by technology, literature, and other resources.
     5. A design of the artefact to be built.
     6. Details of the implementation of the artefact.
     7. An evaluation of your artefact to objectively determine its quality.

8. A conclusion to the report, summarising the findings, discussing related work, and any future work.
