## Matrices

<p>In a computer program, a Matrix is 2-dimensional array. In Machine Learning, matrix multiplicaton its at the core of practically any algorithm, and ML is at the top of the
job ladder. So better get right at a ealy stage.</p>
For a more in-deep mathematical treatment about matrices properties and operations, you can review Appendix D, from our Corman textbook.<br>

### Tasks 1
Based on the above references, please provide an algorithm to multiply three matrices. <br>

### Task 2
Build a matrix calculator. <br>

<p>Provide a program that Add, Subtract and Multiply **two** matrices A and B. Your program should ask the user for the dimensions and values of these matrices. <br>
After asking for A and B, present the user with a menu to choose the desired operation, and then show the resulting matrix. <br>
Give the user the option to either try a different operation, try two different matrices or quit.
