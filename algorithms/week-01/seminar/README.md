## Fibonacci

The Fibonacci numbers Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.

###  F<sub>0</sub> = 0;  F<sub>1</sub> = 0;
###  F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>

This sequence is useful for many thing in mathematics (  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number ) maybe the most famous is its relation with the Golden ratio. 

  print( <expr>, <expr>,  ..., <expr>, end = " \n " )
