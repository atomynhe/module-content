## Methods cheatsheet (summarised from class slides)

**User reserach Methods**
_Use when it is not clear yet exactly what should be built

Method  |  Description
--|--  
Contextual enquiry  |  Working side by side with somebody who already does a job that is going to be automated or redesigned
Participatory workshops  |  Getting everyone involved and collaboratively understanding all aspects of a problem
Observations  |  Use if there is something specific about where or how people will use your product
Interviews  |  Open ended ways to find out more about your users' needs and pain points

**Experimental methods**
_Use at 'alpha' or MVP stage_

Method  |  Description
--|--  
Lab-based usability testing​ | Use when access should be highly reliable for a large number of people with different backgrounds and abilities​, Designs need to already exist​. Disadvantages: expensive, time consuming, prolongs development lifecycle​
Accessibility audits​ | Use when access need to be universal

**Information Architecture (IA) methods​**
_Use when you have a well defined set of users_

Method  |  Description
--|--  
Card sorts​ | Find out how your users categorise information​
Top tasks​ | Find out what is most important to your users​

**Analytics methods**
_Use when you have an existing web product_

Method  |  Description
--|--  
Hotjar  |  Shows where on the page people explore or click
Google analytics  |  Includes search, 'funnels', languages, devices

**Iterative prototyping**

- Use when you are really not sure what will work!​
- Use when you want to keep stakeholders informed and involved in every stage​
- Go lo-fi and MVP​ (minimum viable product)
- Involve users and get frequent feedback
