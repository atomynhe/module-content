I see that you've just completed your MSc in computing and Roehampton Uni.  Thats great.  We do really value career changers and find that people with different experiences really benefit our company, especially in the dev team.

I know you don't have a lot of practical experience in software yet, but using the knowledge you have from your course and previous experiences, have a go at the following questions:


#### Quality

Here at companyx, quality is very important to us.

1. What do you think are the most important elements of a quality control process?
2. Do you have experiences in other work you have done where there are quality processes?  Can you tell me about them?

#### Code reviews

We do regular code reviews.

1. Why do you think code reviews are important?
2. What personal qualities do you think developers need to bring to a code review?


#### When things go wrong...

Unfortunately, things don't always go according to plan. What would you do if...

1. Someone in marketing requests a new feature, but you are concerned that it might have privacy implications.
2. You review code with a developer but you notice that their code could - under certain conditions - go into an infinite loop and crash the server.


#### Development environments

We have a lot of client data in our live database.

1. Using your knowlege of typical development environments, how would you ensure that this data is kept secure while developing and testing bugfixes?
