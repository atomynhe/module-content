# Computing and society week 6
## Getting your stakeholders involved in testing and sign-off


### Projects

We will return to the hypothetical examples from week 2. To remind you:

* You work for the NHS and need to create a booking system for the public for getting their Covid-19 jab
* You work for a start-up that wants to start delivering medicines to care homes from local pharmacies by drone
* You have been asked to help a community group that wants to connect allotment growers to people in the local area that might want to take their excess veg for free
* You are doing research to design devices that might help people with dementia live at home

Here are the slides produced by students + discussion

### Tasks

Simply brainstorm with your group all the different ways that you think the project needs to be tested (internally and with stakeholders) in order to ensure it is ready to be delivered into use.

Use the whiteboard, and see if you can group the the tests into some generic iterations ie:

- Lo fi prototyping
- MVP
- Beta version


**To consider:**
How do you think that involving stakeholders in early-stage research may benefit the eventual quality of your product?
